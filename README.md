![Color Pallette](documentation/palette.png)

I choose main color of brown darken-2 (#5d4037) from materialize color palette and added lighter or darker tones to make sure that works well togheter on to the website. 

## Wireframes

I created wireframes in the Balsamiq program as first visual concept of the website.

# Database

## Data Types
The types of data stored in MongoDB are:
* ObjectId
* String
* Array
* Binary

## Collection Structure
In this case, I have modelled my relational database on a non-relational database system, MongoDB. I have used the MongoDB best practice and guidance taught on the course when migrating relational database platforms to non-relational database platforms as my guide in this case. I have used the following mapping example:

![mapping example](documentation/database.png)

["How to Migrate Relational Database to MongoDB?: Made Easy", Raj Verma](https://hevodata.com/learn/author/raj-verma/)

A dedicated relational database platform like MySQL or PostgreSQL could also have been used in this case.

Cookbook relies on two database collections. 

### Users Collection
Password is entered as string, but stored as binary after encryption trough security werkzeug tool. To log in user - password from database is encrypted to check match with inserted data in the login form.

### Recipes Collection
